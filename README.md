  - Load the data into Rstudio
  - Compute basic statistics for the data using R (i.e., min, max, mean, median, mode, variance, std deviation, IQR, etc.)
  - Detected any outliers in the chosen data
  - Produced different plots using R - simple scatter plots, bar graphs, line graphs, histograms etc.
